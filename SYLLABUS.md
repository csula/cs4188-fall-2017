## Course Information

This course presents an in-depth study of the issues in the design and implementation of compilers. Topics will vary from basic to advanced in areas such as syntax, semantics, binding, data abstraction, exception handling, concurrency, and functional, logic, and objected-oriented programming.


### Objectives

After successful completion of the course, students will
1. Develop a greater understanding of the issues involved in programming language design and implementation
2. Develop an in-depth understanding of functional, logic, and object-oriented programming paradigms
3. Implement several programs in languages other than the one emphasized in the core curriculum (Java/C++)
4. Understand design/implementation issues involved with variable allocation and binding, control flow, types, subroutines, parameter passing
5. Develop an understanding of the compilation process

### Prerequisites

* CS2011, CS2012, and CS2013
* Additionally, students should be familiar with at least one programming language (e.g. C, Java, C++)

### Optional Textbooks

**Programming Language Pragmatics, third edition** by Michael L. Scott, Morgan Kaufmann Publishers.

**The Definitive ANTLR 4 Reference** by Terrence Parr, The Pragmatic Programmers.

Additionally, reading assignments, e.g. papers and videos, will be provided.  Students are expected to keep up with the reading assignments before the start of each lecture.

The above schedule is subject to change depending on the class dynamics.

## Evaluation

* 50% Programming assignments
    * 4 Homework assignments
    * 1 Course project
* 20% Midterm Exam
* 20% Final Exam
* 10% Class Participation

#### Programming Assignments

Four homework will be given, which should be done individually.  For the programming part of the assignments, up to two students may collaborate; note that this information must be documented prior to submission.

Completion of the course project is required for passing the class.

#### Exams

* Midterm: Covering Materials from weeks 1 - 6
* Final Exam: Covering Materials from weeks 8 - 14

#### Class Participation

Class participation is an important component of active learning.  Students are expected to attend class and participate in discussion.  Class participation contribution can make a difference between a passing and a failing final grade.

### Grading Metrics

For all assignments, their numerical grading equivalent, and course grade, the grading criteria is described as follows:

A – Outstanding Work: In addition to the criteria for a “B”, superior knowledge regarding details, assumptions,
implications, history; superior thinking with information relevant to application, critique, and relationship to other information. An outstanding mastery of the subject with excellence evident in preparation for and attendance in class sessions, curious and retentive mind, unusual ability to analyze and synthesize material, with a positive attitude making productive contributions to the learning community in the classroom with

B – Above Average Work: In addition to the criteria for a “C”, more than adequate knowledge regarding technical terms, distinctions, and possesses an ability to use information. Above average student in terms of attendance, preparation, time management, mostly consistent in test taking, and attitude.

C – Average Work: Basic knowledge needed to function and carry on learning regarding major principles, central terms, major figures, also possesses an awareness of field or discipline. Average or typical student in terms of attendance, preparation, time management, inconsistent test taking, and attitude.

D – Below Average Work: Serious gaps in knowledge, confusion of concepts and categories, inability to recall basic information. Below average or atypical student in terms of attendance, preparation, time management, inconsistent test taking, and attitude--minimally passing in performance.

F – Not Acceptable Work: Absence of knowledge, incapable of carrying on a conversation about the subject, misunderstands most concepts, confuses all categories. Inadequate/insufficient performance.

**Incompletes** will not be given for this course without extenuating circumstances and convincing reasons demonstrated by the student to the instructor’s satisfaction.

### Grading Scale

* A  93 - 100
* A- 90 - 92
* B+ 87 - 89
* B  83 - 86
* B- 80 - 82
* C+ 77 - 79
* C  74 - 76
* C- 70 - 72
* D  60 - 69
* F  < 60

### Academic Integrity

The mission of CSUDH includes cultivating in each student not only the academic skills that are required for a university degree, but also the characteristics of academic integrity that are integral to a CSUDH education. It is therefore part of the mission of the university to nurture in each student a sense of moral responsibility consistent with the biblical teachings of honesty and accountability. Furthermore, a breach of academic integrity is viewed not merely as a private matter between the student and an instructor but rather as an act which is fundamentally inconsistent with the purpose and mission of the entire university.

**Consequences for violations of academic integrity in this class will automatically receive an “F” in the course and may be in jeopardy of expulsion from the university.**

**Academic dishonesty includes:**

**Cheating** – Intentionally using or attempting to use unauthorized materials, information, or study aids in any academic exercise.
   * Students completing any examination should assume that external assistance (e.g., books, notes, calculators, and conversations with others) is prohibited unless specifically authorized by the instructor.
   * Students may not allow others to conduct research or prepare work for them without advance authorization from the instructor.
   * Substantial portions of the same academic work may not be submitted for credit in more than one course without authorization.

**Fabrication** – Intentional falsification or invention of any information or citation in an academic exercise.

**Facilitating academic dishonesty** – Intentionally or knowingly helping or attempting to help another commit an act of academic dishonesty.

**Plagiarism** – Intentionally or knowingly representing the words, ideas, or work of another as one’s own in any academic exercise.

## Disability Services

Students in this course who have a disability that might prevent them from fully demonstrating their abilities should meet with an advisor in the Office of Special Services as soon as possible to initiate disability verification and discuss accommodations that may be necessary to ensure full participation in the successful completion of course requirements
